# eerie-db

The database of Eerie packages. So far it allows you to install packages using
their names instead of the URLs.

To add your package to the database, open a PR where you put a copy of your
package `eerie.json` file into `db` directory and rename the file to
`YourPackageName.json`.

See [Eerie documentation](https://iolanguage.github.io/eerie) for information on
creating packages.
